# Notes of common code used

Code from Challenge #1 was borrowed for some of the basic framework of the html and css folder. In HTML, the Head section was copied over and the anchor tags within the body that push the user towards the individual body sections were copied over, but customized for this assignment. 

# What was done with this challenge

We were given an assignment to create a personal portfolio that would house information about us, links to our projects in class, a contact information, and a resume link. We were given no starter code and had to write all code from scratch.

a css reset file is ran before the style css file to reset and browser preset styling attributes.

The header section has my name, and links to jump to id sections of the page of interest.

Some noteable customization happened wwith the "My Work" images and their project titles. images were enhanced so that the first project image would be larger than the rest, while the other 4 were broken into sets of two on seperate articles. Then each image was given it's own figure so a <p> element could be given an absolute refrence to the <figure> element's relative position. Images were given a hover feature to dark photos, and each image in the work section links to a project page. Images also have a border and box shadow styling.

Footer has contact information and socials for future employers to look at
